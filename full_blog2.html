            He is the most mature and the most childish person at the same time,
            I don't even know how to not laugh while making this rhyme ...
            Even at the most senseless talks i laugh at his reactions,
            I don't know how he look so funny in every act and actions..
            I never thought I would be so comfortable and safe around him,
            He and his attitude makes him the sweetest boy and people think he need a gym....
            He is known to the people because he is a really cool,
            How he is able to do is...is because he behave the atmost fool...
            Whatever it is..atleast he try to make people feel good and happy,
            This is the quality which attract the people and i don't know how he is so snappy...
            He is all rounder and our topmost happiness layer,
            What I love the most about him is that he respect and care.</pre>
