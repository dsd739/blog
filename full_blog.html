        <pre>            In pain, in happiness and in every situation she is always there by my side, 
            She is the reason i enjoy living the life and look how beautiful is the life ride...
            Just look how i am so real when I am surrounded by her,

            I and my mind feel the lightest around her just like a light feather or a fur.....
            No one can actually understand how can someone be so beautiful in and out,
            I don't know about people but in this case i had no objections and doubt....
            She is the most caring and the most loyal person and friend , 

            I also don't know how we talk so much and touchwood our conversation never end...
            Everyone has advantages and disadvantages in themselves,

            The biggest advantage and disadvantage of her is she put people first and then herself...
            Even if I am hiding my emotions she knows exactly what I am feeling,

            The time i spend with her is the medicine due to which I am healing....
            Whatever the situation is she is  always by my side,
            I cried, i cried, i cried but she is the reason i atleast tried. 
            She is the one who will never tell on my face that she care,

            Insulting and making fun of me is the only way I can be aware...
            She can make fun of me but she never give someone else this opportunity,
            In this case, i don't know how her taunts and talks becomes so witty..? 
            I love her the most and i am never gonna change her place in my heart,
            Living with her is so adorable...it feels like I am living in the most beautiful art.</pre>
