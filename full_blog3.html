            The first impression of him was not that great and nice,
            I felt we would never vibe and become friends that too this wise...
            Sometimes he act weird and we get irritated,
            But feels good when he is around..between us he is laminated...
            I don't know how to explain the bond we share,
            He is hard to understand but atleast he is not fake and he cares....
            Sometimes he is the most annoying among us and a total mess,
            I don't know what more to write on him i am really " speechless".</pre>
